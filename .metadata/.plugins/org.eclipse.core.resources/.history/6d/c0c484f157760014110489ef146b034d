				improve our services to you. We respect your right to privacy and
				take the responsibility of protecting your data and using it only in
				a way that you would expect, very seriously. The purpose of this
				policy (the “Privacy Policy”) is to outline how we deal with any
				personal data you provide to us while visiting the Site. By visiting
				this Site, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy. We
				hope that you will find everything you need to know about how we
				protect your personal data and what uses we make of it below.</p>
				<h3>Personal Information: What we Collect and Why</h3> 
				<p>We only ask you for
				the information we need to allow you to use a particular function of
				the site. This includes your name and email address when adding a
				comment or rating a part of the site. We may request additional
				information for competitions so that we can contact you in a
				convenient manner and assess your eligibility to enter.</p>
				<h3>We do not Share your Data</h3> 
				<p>The information we need about you is not shared with
				any third parties beyond our trusted partners who need to have
				access to this data in order to provide our online services and
				unless you indicate otherwise, with third parties who may have
				promotions and other goods and services which may be of interest to
				you or your household and successors to our business or the business
				of your local Corrigans Supermarket with which you have shopped. Your data is
				processed by our main web partners and our Real Rewards partners.
				Each of these partners is committed to protecting your data in line
				with the rigorous demands we place on them. We may use and share
				non-personal information, as it relates to sets or groups of
				customers, to enhance our understanding of customer behaviour and
				enable us to improve our service in general. We will disclose your
				personal data if we believe in good faith that we are required to
				disclose it in order to comply with any applicable law, a summons, a
				search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other statutory
				requirement.</p>

				steps (including appropriate technical and organisational measures)

				need, we also gather statistical and other analytical information of
