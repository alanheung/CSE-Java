//1.In a method called thirdOrderPolynomial(), calculate the third order 
//polynomial of x (the formula is fx = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d. Get the coefficients (a,b,c and d) from the user. 
//Inside a while loop, ask the user for x. Calculate the fx value and output the result. Ask the user if he/she wished to continue. 
//Note: all types are double.
//pass a b c d from main to the thirdOrderPolynomial method
//2. in method whileaverage calc the average if n numbers based on the user inputs
//use while loop, loop for iterations get num from user when loop is finished calc 
//the average without losing decimal
//3.In a method called whileGrades(), code a while loop that asks the user for a grade (a-f). Use the toLowerCase() method to deal 
//with lowercase letters only. Count up the number of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, E’s and F’s entered. “x” or “X” exits the loop. 
//After the loop exits, output the count of each grade.
//4.In a method called whileHistogram(), ask the user for the number of rows and columns. Using while loops, output a 
//histogram i.e. if rows is 3 and columns is 4, then output 3 rows, each row containing 4 stars each.
